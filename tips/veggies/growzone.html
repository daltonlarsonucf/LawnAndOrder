      <h3 class="ti-h3">Where to Plant</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">When choosing a garden space, it needs to be a spot that receives 6-8 hours of sun every day. An area that has a North-South orientation is ideal. Make sure you choose a space that is close to a water source since these plants need hands on tending!</p>

      <h3 class="ti-h3">Choosing Crops</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">It is recommended to talk to those you live with to see which vegetable everyone wants in the garden. According to the USDA Gardening Zones, Central Florida falls under the 9A category. This means, you can grow almost any vegetable without worrying about harsh winter and the growing season is a lot longer than most - this means you can plant almost year-round! Although it varies a little bit by month, you can plant things such as: beets, kale, eggplant, onion, turnips, peas, carrots, cauliflower, leeks, okra, peppers, potatoes, pumpkins, beans, corn, and many more! If your garden is smaller, use smaller vegetables such as cherry tomatoes and mini carrots instead of melons and beans which are vining and take up a lot of room. Additional research will be required based off of which crops you would want.</p>

      <h3 class="ti-h3">Mapping</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">Drawing or mapping out your garden layout beforehand will help give you a visually for how much space you will have for each plant. This will end up saving you money by not over purchasing. This is also recommended so you can see how to place your taller plants in a way that it will not block sunlight from the shorter ones. It is also smart to have some type of paved way of straw or grass, so you do not step on any vegetables.</p>
