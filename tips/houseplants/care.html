      <h3 class="ti-h3">Care</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">A good rule of green thumb is to remember that everything needs to be done in moderation. All plants need water, light, and food, but the key to success is to practice moderation.
        <p class="ti-para"><strong class="green">Soil</strong>
        <br>The best media to use to grow your plants is soil-less - it is a combination of equal parts pea moss, vermiculite/perlite, and compost. Keep in mind that some plants are a bit picky, such as orchids. They need a different type of mixture that is a well-drained mixture with a lot of room for it to breathe.
        <br><br><strong class="green">Water</strong>
        <br>A great way to see if a plant needs water is to pick it up! See how much it weighs. If it feels too light, it needs some water, if not leave it alone. Most plants would rather be a bit dry instead of soaking wet. Watering twice a week is typically suitable for most houseplants. When watering, you should do it slowly. Once you see that water is escaping through the drainage holes at the bottom of the container, you should stop watering. In winter, your plant usually only needs watering a few times a month. Having a spray bottle to lightly mist your plants once or twice a day is beneficial - this gives the effect of humidity. Keeping a tray underneath your plant is a fantastic way to avoid a mess. The tray will catch any excess water.
        <br><br><strong class="green">Light</strong>
        <br>Light is just as important was water! See our previous tab for lighting tips!
        <br><br><strong class="green">Fertilizer</strong>
        <br>Adding fertilizer is a great way to help your plants receive more food that keeps them happy and healthy. This can be through a granule that breaks down over time or directly via a water-soluble fertilizer. Granules will need to be applied once every few months, while water-soluble fertilizer needs to be applied about every two weeks.
        <br><br><strong class="green">Temperature</strong>
        <br>Keeping the plants in a warm environment with air circulation is ideal. Most houseplants need a minimum of 55&#176F to survive. Creating airflow - such as running the ceiling fan - is a good way to circulate the air. However, this can make your plants become a bit dusty, which will affect them. Use a cloth to wipe them down.
