      <h3 class="ti-h3">Lighting</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">Each plant has different needs, and it is highly recommended that you do research on what your specific plant needs! However, it can be difficult to provide the necessary light for your plants due to seasonal changes or lack of window space.
      <p class="ti-para"><strong class="green">LED Lights</strong>
        <br>This is the most common way to provide “sunlight” to houseplants. The bulbs are very efficient in producing little heat compared to how bright they are. There are many different options, sizes, lamps, etc. out there so you can pick which best fits your aesthetics and space. These lights provide full-spectrum lighting, but it’s even cooler because some of them can be programmed at different levels of intensity at different times of the day. You can even sync your lights to your smart phone!
        <br><br><strong class="green">Incandescent Lights</strong>
        <br>If you have low-light houseplants such as ferns, vines, or dracaenas, this is a good light for you! They put out 10% of light and 90% of heat, so these aren’t the most beneficial for tropical plants, cacti, or succulents.
        <br><br><strong class="green">Fluorescent Lights</strong>
        <br>These lights are good for plants that need low to medium light. These are ideal if you wanted to grow vegetables indoors.  The narrower the bulb is, the more efficient and brighter the light. With most houseplants, bulbs between 4,000 and 6,000 Kelvin are recommended. Using a T5 bulb is the most common choice.
        <br><br><strong class="green">Halides</strong>
        <br>This light is generally used on larger plants within larger spaces.
