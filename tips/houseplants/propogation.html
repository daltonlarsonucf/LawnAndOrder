      <h3 class="ti-h3">What is Propgation?</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">Propagation is creating a new plant from one you already own. Some popular houseplants that people
        love to propagate are the ZZ plant (zamioculcas zamiifolia), snake plant (sansevieria), and Pothos or Devils Ivy
        (epipremnum aureum). Propagation is a great and simple way to expand your collection from plants you already own!
        Propagation requires patience because it is not always successful, it is very experimental. Think of it as if you're
        performing a cloning experiment of your plant! Be wary though, these cuttings and new plants will need a lot more
        attention than your fully grown ones.</p>

      <h3 class="ti-h3">Methods</h3>
      <p class="ti-para"><strong>Division</strong> is separating an already growing plant.</p>
      <p class="ti-list">
        <br><strong>Step 1:</strong> Choose your plant, duh! Have tools such as shears, new compost or soil, a garden spade, etc.
        <br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Empty your plant onto your work surface!
        <br><strong>Step 3:</strong> Loosen the soil from the roots. Carefully and slowly pry the pants apart. You will be able to see where the separate plants have form. Your goal is to break the plants into different pieces while keeping the healthy roots attached to each of the pieces.
        <br><strong>Step 4:</strong> Use the shears to separate the root ball.
        <br><strong>Step 5:</strong> Clean up the roots as much as you can while keeping it as intact as possible.
        <br><strong>Step 6:</strong> Fill the pots with new compost or soil. It is beneficial to mix water retention crystals or plant fertilizer into the soil at this stage.
        <br><strong>Step 7:</strong> Put the plants into the pot and add more soil just below the line of the pot. And you're done with this method!

      <p class="ti-para"><strong>Rooting a Leaf or a Cutting</strong><br>Some, but not all plants can be propagated from a leaf.</p>
      <p class="ti-list">
        <br><strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove a leaf and include up to 1 & 1/2 inches of the petiole.
          <br>For <strong class="green">succulents</strong>, remove a handful of leaves from the stem, place them on a flat surface (like a cookie sheet covered in soil), wait for them to scab over before planting in the soil to grow tiny "pups".
          <br>For <strong class="green">monsteras and philodendrons</strong>, use a trimming technique. Cut off an offshoot that already has one or two root notches (the little bumps where roots are beginning to grow again).
          <br>For <strong class="green">fiddle leaf figs</strong>, you can trim individual leaves close to the main stem.
        <br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Insert the lower end of the petiole into the medium - using clear jars of water is a good option for most plants but using soil works too.
        <br><strong>Step 3:</strong> Keep the plants in indirect sunlight. If using water, you only need to change out the water if it starts to look a bit gross or if a lot has evaporated.
        <br><strong>Step 4:</strong> (If using water instead of soil) Put your plants in a pot with soil when roots are about two to four inches long.
