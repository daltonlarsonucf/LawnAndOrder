      <h3 class="ti-h3">Location</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">Whether you decide to grow your herbs indoors or outdoors, you must make sure it can receive at least 6 hours of sunlight. Some herbs (cilantro, mint, parsley) do well with just 3 or 4 hours. It is best to do independent research based on herbs that will best suit the environment you have. Having your herb garden near your kitchen will be the most beneficial for you as you can just grab a snip of whatever you need. It is also nice to have it in the kitchen so you can keep an easier eye on your plants and see if they need watering.
      <br>If you have a yard with well-draining soil in a sunny spot away from trees and shrubs, having your garden there would work. If you don’t, say your soil is less than ideal, using a raised garden bed is a great alternative! If your growing space is small, growing your herbs in pots work just as well. Extra research would need to be done to find the right size and style of containers.</p>

      <h3 class="ti-h3">Choosing the Right Plants</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">Making a list of flavors you like to eat and want is a good way to start. If you’re a chef or you have cooking as a hobby, adding herbs that are classic like rosemary, thyme, and oregano are great starters. If you like to do crafts, add lavender for projects. Add whatever suits your interests. Next step will be to plant your garden. View our guide on how to grow them from seeds!</p>

      <h3 class="ti-h3">Harvesting</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">Harvesting your plants frequently is healthy for your herbs. It actually makes them grow back thicker and bushier. It is best to harvest in the morning, so you don’t stress out your herbs. Never remove more than one-third of the plant. Also, herbs taste best before flowering.</p>
