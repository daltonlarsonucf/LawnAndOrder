      <h3 class="ti-h3">What is Propgation?</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">Propagation is creating a new plant from one you already own. Propagation is a great and simple way to expand your collection from plants you already own! Propagation requires patience because it is not always successful, it is very experimental. Think of it as if you’re performing a cloning experiment of your plant! Be wary though, these cuttings and new plants will need a lot more attention than your filly grown ones. For herbs, the quickest way to get more plants is from stem cuttings.</p>

      <h3 class="ti-h3">When to Propogate</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">The best time do take a cutting is during its active growth season. This is usually between spring and fall. It is best practice to take the cuttings of herbs that are not flowering.</p>

      <h3 class="ti-h3">How to Cut</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">When you take a look at a stem you should see two sections a <strong  class="green">softwood</strong> and a <strong  class="green">hardwood</strong>. The softwood would be lighter and be pretty flexible. This is the part you need. You will want to cut right under the node (where the leaves join the stem) and have 4-6 inches of cutting. After cutting, you should pinch the leaves off the bottom 2 inches – this will be where the new roots will emerge. Try to do your cuttings in the mornings because it causes less stress on the herbs.</p>

      <h3 class="ti-h3">Growing Propogations</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">After you get your cuttings, you can choose between a water or in a growing medium to grow them. However, for both, you need to cover the cuttings with a plastic bag. This helps the herb retain moisture. If you choose to grow in a glass of water, you need the glass/jar to have enough water to cover the stems and no leaves should be in the water. The plant should be placed in a bright area with the plastic bag over it for about 3-4 weeks. After that time, you should put them in a pot. If you choose to grow in a growing medium, using a soilless medium is best. You can dip the stems in a rooting hormone before adding them to the pot. After potting, water the cuttings and cover it with a plastic bag and in about 3-4 weeks it will root. The cuttings must remain moist, so it is a good idea to remove the plastic cover and turn it inside out to remove any condensation. For the growing medium, the soil should only be watered when dry, for the water medium, add water if the water in the jar is below the stems.
