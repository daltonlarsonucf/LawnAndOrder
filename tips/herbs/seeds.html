      <h3 class="ti-h3">Soaking</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">A day before you plan on planting, it might be best to soak your herb seeds. It is not essential, but soaking softens the outer shell and can increase its germination rates. Parsley and coriander benefit from a 12-24 hour presoak.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ti-box">
      <h3 class="ti-h3">Temperature</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">Herbs, like all living things, are sensitive to temperatures. Too hot or too cold and they will not be happy! If you’re growing seeds indoors while in anticipation for spring, cold windows might be an issue. Getting sun from the window is important, but only after your seeds have sprouted. In the germination state, sun is not as important. The herbs will think if it is too cold, winter is still out there so they cannot sprout. Aiming for a 65-75ºF is the goal. If this temperature is a bit unattainable, getting a heat mat to place under the seeds would be a good idea.</p>

    <div class="ti-box">
      <h3 class="ti-h3">Lighting</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">Some herbs do not need any light and prefer darkness (basil, oregano, parsley, chives), so placing a thin layer of soil over them is recommended. The depth of the soil should not be deeper than the depth of the seed. Other herbs (thyme) need more light so placing their seeds close to the surface is best.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="ti-box">
      <h3 class="ti-h3">What's Next?</h3>
      <p class="ti-para">After the seeds have sprouted (which might take 2-15 days) you just need to keep your herbs happy! The soil should be damp, but not soggy. Certain herbs, like basil, can tolerate an environment with more water; however, herbs like rosemary and oregano prefer drier climates. After a few weeks of planting, you should add supplemental nutrients to your herbs. This can be done by adding high quality potting mix or a liquid plant food top-up. Herbs need light to make their own food. Make sure each plant is getting enough light.</p>
